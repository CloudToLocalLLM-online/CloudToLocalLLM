  DioException [bad response]: This exception was thrown because the response has a status code of 400 and RequestOptions.validateStatus was configured to throw for this status code.
  The status code of 400 has the following meaning: "Client error - the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled"
  Read more about status codes at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status
  In order to resolve this exception you typically have either to verify and fix your request code or you have to fix the server code.

Warning: At least one test in this suite creates an HttpClient. When running a test suite that uses
TestWidgetsFlutterBinding, all HTTP requests will return status code 400, and no network request
will actually be made. Any test expecting a real network connection and status code will fail.
To test code that needs an HttpClient, provide your own HttpClient implementation to the code under
test, so that your test can consistently provide a testable response to the code under test.
