# Cline Tool Demonstration Summary

This file summarizes the capabilities of Cline, a highly skilled software engineer AI, through demonstrations of its available tools.

## Core Tools

### `list_files`
Lists files and directories.
*   **Demonstration:** Performed a non-recursive listing of the current directory, showing top-level files and folders.

### `read_file`
Reads the contents of a file.
*   **Demonstration:** Read the `README.md` file, displaying its full content.

### `write_to_file`
Creates a new file or overwrites an existing one.
*   **Demonstration:** Created this `cline_tool_demonstration.md` file.

### `replace_in_file`
Makes targeted edits to an existing file.
*   **Demonstration:** Used to add sections for each tool's demonstration to this file.

### `execute_command`
Executes a CLI command on the system.
*   **Demonstration:** Ran `git status` to show the current state of the Git repository.

### `list_code_definition_names`
Lists definition names (classes, functions, methods) in source code files.
*   **Note:** This tool did not return any definitions when attempted on Dart files in `lib` and `lib/services`, indicating potential incompatibility with Dart or specific project structure.

### `search_files`
Performs a regex search across files.
*   **Demonstration:** Searched for "CloudToLocalLLM" in `README.md`, returning all occurrences with context.

## MCP Tool Demonstrations

### `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/memory`
This MCP server provides tools for interacting with a knowledge graph.
*   **`create_entities`**: Created entities like "Cline" and "CloudToLocalLLM".
*   **`create_relations`**: Created a "is working on" relation between "Cline" and "CloudToLocalLLM".
*   **`read_graph`**: Read the current state of the knowledge graph, confirming the created entities and relations.

### `github.com/upstash/context7-mcp`
This MCP server provides tools for resolving library IDs and fetching documentation.
*   **`resolve-library-id`**: Resolved "react" to its Context7-compatible library ID `/context7/react_dev`.
*   **`get-library-docs`**: Fetched documentation for `/context7/react_dev` on the topic of "hooks", providing relevant code snippets and API references.

### `sequential-thinking`
This MCP server provides a tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving.
*   **`sequentialthinking`**: Demonstrated a three-step thought process, showing how thoughts can be chained and built upon.

### `github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server`
This MCP server was attempted but is not currently connected.
*   **Error:** "No connection found for server: github.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server."

### `web_fetch`
Fetches content from a specified URL and processes it into markdown.
*   **Demonstration:** Fetched content from `https://docs.cline.bot/features`, providing a markdown representation of the page.

### `browser_action`
Interacts with a Puppeteer-controlled browser.
*   **Demonstration:** Attempted to launch `web/index.html`. The page was blank with "file not found" errors, indicating that direct local file access might not fully render the application due to security or resource loading issues.

### `ask_followup_question`
Asks the user a question to gather additional information.
*   **Demonstration:** Asked "What is your preferred programming language for web development?" with options, and received "Other" as the answer.
