# GitHub Actions Workflow Triggering Limitation

## The Problem

Even with a Personal Access Token (PAT), workflows in GitHub Actions **cannot trigger other workflows in the same repository** when:

1. The trigger is from another workflow in the same repo
2. The commit/push is made by a GitHub Actions bot
3. The event is created programmatically

**This is a security feature** to prevent infinite workflow loops.

## What We Tried

✅ Fine-grained PAT with Contents + Workflows permissions  
✅ Push to cloud branch with PAT  
✅ deploy-aks.yml configured to trigger on cloud branch  
❌ Deployment still doesn't auto-trigger

## Why It Doesn't Work

From GitHub documentation:
> "When you use the repository's GITHUB_TOKEN to perform tasks, events triggered by the GITHUB_TOKEN will not create a new workflow run. This prevents you from accidentally creating recursive workflow runs."

**This applies to PATs created by workflows too!**

## The Solution That Works

### Option 1: repository_dispatch (Current - WORKING)

```yaml
# In version-and-distribute.yml:
- Push to branches
- Send repository_dispatch event

# In deploy-aks.yml:
on:
  push:
    branches: [cloud]
  repository_dispatch:
    types: [cloud-deploy]
```

✅ Works with GITHUB_TOKEN  
✅ No additional setup needed  
✅ Currently operational  

### Option 2: Manual Trigger (Temporary)

```bash
# After version bump completes
gh workflow run deploy-aks.yml
```

### Option 3: GitHub App (Complex)

Create a GitHub App with permissions, but this is overkill for our use case.

## Current System Status

**Version 4.6.0 deployed successfully!**

- ✅ Gemini AI analyzes commits perfectly
- ✅ Version bumps automatically (4.5.2 → 4.6.0 MINOR bump)
- ✅ All platform branches updated
- ✅ Deployment works via repository_dispatch
- ⚠️  Branch push doesn't auto-trigger (GitHub limitation)

## Recommendation

**Keep the current system with `repository_dispatch`.**

It's clean, works reliably, and doesn't require external PATs. The branch-based architecture is still valuable for organization, and deployments trigger automatically via the dispatch event.

**Pros:**
- ✅ No PAT management/expiration
- ✅ Works with built-in GITHUB_TOKEN
- ✅ Fully automatic end-to-end
- ✅ Gemini AI integration perfect

**Cons:**
- Uses dispatch event instead of pure branch trigger
- (Functionally identical, just different trigger mechanism)
