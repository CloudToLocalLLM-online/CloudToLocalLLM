# AI-Powered CI/CD System

## Overview

CloudToLocalLLM uses an innovative **unified AI-powered CI/CD system** that consolidates analysis, building, and deployment into a single intelligent workflow. This system leverages **Gemini CLI** with **Gemini 2.0 Flash** to make intelligent decisions about when and where to deploy changes, eliminating the complexity of orchestrated workflows while maintaining sophisticated deployment logic.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Unified Deployment Workflow** (`deploy.yml`)
   - Single workflow handling all deployment types
   - Triggered on every push to `main` branch
   - Integrates AI analysis, version management, and multi-platform deployment
   - Replaces the previous orchestrator-based system

2. **AI Analysis Engine** (Integrated)
   - Uses Gemini CLI with Gemini 2.0 Flash
   - Analyzes commits and file changes within the unified workflow
   - Determines platform deployment needs and version bumps
   - Provides intelligent deployment decisions with reasoning

3. **Multi-Platform Build System**
   - Conditional cloud service building (web, api-backend, streaming-proxy)
   - Desktop application builds (Windows, future Linux)
   - Mobile build support (placeholder for future implementation)
   - All platforms handled within single workflow execution

### Unified Workflow Sequence

    Deploy->>AI: Analyze changes (integrated)
    AI->>Deploy: Return analysis & decisions
    Deploy->>Deploy: Update version files & commit
    Deploy->>Build: Conditional platform builds
    Build->>Cloud: Deploy services (if needed)
    Deploy->>Deploy: Generate deployment summary
```

## AI Analysis System

### Gemini CLI Integration

**Installation**:
```bash
# The CLI is automatically set up in GitHub Actions
chmod +x scripts/gemini-cli.cjs
sudo ln -sf "$(pwd)/scripts/gemini-cli.cjs" /usr/local/bin/gemini-cli
```

**Configuration**:
- **Model**: Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **API Key**: Stored in `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Timeout**: Configured for reliable analysis
- **Fallback**: Graceful error handling with manual override options

### Analysis Process

The AI system analyzes multiple data points to make deployment decisions:

1. **Recent Commits** (last 3 commits)
   - Commit messages and semantic meaning
   - Conventional commit patterns (feat:, fix:, BREAKING:)
   - Developer intent and change scope

2. **Changed Files** (last 5 commits)
   - File paths and extensions
   - Directory structure changes
   - Dependency modifications

3. **Platform Impact Assessment**
   - Web-related changes (frontend, backend, auth)
   - Desktop-specific modifications
   - Mobile platform changes
   - Infrastructure and configuration updates

### Platform Detection Rules

#### Cloud Deployment (`needs_cloud=true`)

**Always Triggers Cloud Deployment**:
- Changes to `web/`, `lib/`, `services/` directories
- Modifications to `k8s/`, `config/` directories
- Updates to `.github/workflows/deploy-aks.yml`
- Changes to `auth0-bridge.js`, `router.dart`
- Any authentication provider modifications
- **Critical**: Auth0, authentication, login, web interface changes

**File Pattern Matching**:
```bash
# Examples of cloud-triggering changes
web/auth0-bridge.js                    # Auth0 integration
lib/services/auth_service.dart         # Authentication service
services/api-backend/src/auth.js       # API authentication
k8s/web-deployment.yaml               # Kubernetes deployment
config/nginx/nginx.conf               # Web server configuration
```

#### Desktop Deployment (`needs_desktop=true`)

**Triggers Desktop Builds**:
- Changes to `windows/`, `linux/` directories
- Desktop-specific Flutter code
- Platform-specific dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`
- Desktop window management or system integration

#### Mobile Deployment (`needs_mobile=true`)

**Triggers Mobile Builds**:
- Changes to `android/`, `ios/` directories
- Mobile-specific Flutter code
- Mobile platform dependencies
- Mobile-specific permissions or configurations

### Conservative Decision Making

The AI system follows a **conservative approach** to ensure reliability:

- **Default to Cloud**: When uncertain about web impact, defaults to `needs_cloud=true`
- **Authentication Priority**: Any authentication-related changes trigger cloud deployment
- **Safety First**: Better to deploy unnecessarily than miss critical updates
- **Explicit Rules**: Clear, documented rules prevent ambiguous decisions

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

The AI automatically determines appropriate version bumps:

**Major Version** (`x.0.0`):
- Breaking changes detected in commits
- API changes that break compatibility
- Major architectural modifications

**Minor Version** (`x.y.0`):
- New features added
- Non-breaking enhancements
- New functionality introduction

**Patch Version** (`x.y.z`):
- Bug fixes and patches
- Chores and maintenance
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements

### Version Validation

**Strict Validation Rules**:
```bash
# Version must be higher than current version
if [ "$NEW_VERSION" <= "$CURRENT_VERSION" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Version must increase"
    exit 1
fi

# Version must follow semantic versioning format
if ! echo "$NEW_VERSION" | grep -qE '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$'; then
    echo "ERROR: Invalid version format"
    exit 1
fi
```

**Version Synchronization**:
- Updates `assets/version.json` (primary source)
- Synchronizes `pubspec.yaml` for Flutter
- Updates `package.json` for Node.js services
- Creates git tags for tracking

## Platform Distribution

### Branch Strategy

The orchestrator creates and manages platform-specific branches:

**Cloud Branch** (`cloud`):
- Contains web-ready code
- Triggers Azure AKS deployment
- Tagged with `{version}-cloud-{sha}`

**Desktop Branch** (`desktop`):
- Contains desktop-optimized code
- Triggers desktop application builds
- Tagged with `{version}-desktop-{sha}`

**Mobile Branch** (`mobile`):
- Contains mobile-ready code
- Future: Will trigger mobile app builds
- Tagged with `{version}-mobile-{sha}`

### Repository Dispatch

When cloud deployment is needed, the orchestrator triggers the deployment workflow:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: token $PAT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo/dispatches \
  -d '{"event_type":"cloud-deploy-4.5.1","client_payload":{"version":"4.5.1","branch":"cloud"}}'
```

## Development Workflow

### For Developers

**Normal Development**:
1. Make changes and commit to feature branch
2. Create pull request to `main`
3. Merge PR - **AI automatically handles the rest in unified workflow**
4. Monitor single workflow execution in GitHub Actions

**Manual Deployments**:
```bash
# Manual unified workflow trigger
gh workflow run deploy.yml

# Force deployment regardless of AI analysis
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f force_deployment=true

# Override deployment type
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f deployment_type=cloud
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f deployment_type=desktop
gh workflow run deploy.yml -f deployment_type=all
```

**Skip Deployment**:
```bash
# Skip CI/CD entirely
git commit -m "docs: update README [skip ci]"

# Skip version bumping but allow other CI
git commit -m "chore: minor cleanup [no-version]"
```

### Commit Message Best Practices

To help the AI make better decisions, use conventional commit messages:

```bash
# Feature additions (minor version bump)
git commit -m "feat: add new user dashboard component"
git commit -m "feat(auth): implement OAuth2 refresh token rotation"

# Bug fixes (patch version bump)
git commit -m "fix: resolve login loop in Auth0 bridge"
git commit -m "fix(api): handle null user profile gracefully"

# Breaking changes (major version bump)
git commit -m "feat!: redesign authentication API"
git commit -m "BREAKING CHANGE: remove deprecated user endpoints"

# Chores and maintenance (patch version bump)
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies to latest versions"
git commit -m "docs: improve API documentation"
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Workflow Monitoring

**Check Unified Workflow Status**:
```bash
# List recent deployment runs
gh run list --workflow="deploy.yml" --limit 5

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id>

# Check AI analysis output
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep "Gemini Analysis"

# Check deployment decision summary
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep "Deployment Decision Summary" -A 10
```

**Monitor Deployment Status**:
```bash
# Check all deployment jobs in single workflow
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep -E "(ai_analysis|build_cloud_services|deploy_cloud|build_desktop)"

# Check version tags (created directly on main)
git tag | tail -10

# Verify deployment summary
gh run view <run-id> --log | grep "Unified Deployment Summary" -A 20
```

### Debugging AI Decisions

**Local Testing**:
```bash
# Run analysis locally
./scripts/analyze-platforms.sh

# Test Gemini CLI
gemini-cli "Analyze this change: fix auth login loop"

# Check environment
echo $GEMINI_API_KEY
```

**Common Issues**:

1. **AI Analysis Fails**:
   - Check Gemini API key validity
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Review prompt formatting

2. **Wrong Platform Detection**:
   - Review changed files list
   - Check AI reasoning in logs
   - Verify detection rules

3. **Version Conflicts**:
   - Ensure version.json is up to date
   - Check for concurrent workflow runs
   - Verify git tag consistency

## Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Clear Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit format to help AI analysis
2. **Logical Changes**: Group related changes in single commits
3. **Test Locally**: Verify changes work before pushing
4. **Monitor Deployments**: Check that AI made correct deployment decisions

### For Maintainers

1. **Review AI Decisions**: Periodically audit AI analysis accuracy
2. **Update Rules**: Refine platform detection rules based on experience
3. **Monitor Costs**: Track AI API usage and deployment frequency
4. **Backup Plans**: Maintain manual override procedures

### Security Considerations

1. **API Key Management**: Secure Gemini API key in GitHub Secrets
2. **Branch Protection**: Protect platform branches from direct pushes
3. **Audit Trail**: All AI decisions logged in workflow runs
4. **Fallback Procedures**: Manual deployment options available

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Enhanced AI Prompts**: More sophisticated analysis prompts
2. **Learning System**: AI learns from deployment outcomes
3. **Multi-Model Support**: Fallback to different AI models
4. **Cost Optimization**: Intelligent deployment scheduling
