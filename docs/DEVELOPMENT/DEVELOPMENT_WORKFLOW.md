# CloudToLocalLLM Development Workflow

This document describes the development workflow for the CloudToLocalLLM project. It is designed to ensure consistent code quality and streamline the development process.

## Collaborative Workflow with Gemini

This project follows a collaborative development workflow between the developer and the Gemini AI assistant.

**1. Plan the Work:**
*   For each ticket, Gemini will analyze the requirements and propose a detailed implementation plan.
*   The developer will review and approve the plan before any changes are made.

**2. Implement and Review:**
*   Gemini will implement the changes as planned.
*   After implementation, Gemini will present the changes to the developer for review.

**3. Commit and Push:**
*   Once the developer approves the changes, Gemini will commit them to the `main` branch.
*   The commit message will be descriptive and will include the ticket ID (e.g., `feat(cicd): CLO-32 Optimize GitHub Actions workflows`).

**4. Close the Ticket:**
*   After the changes are committed and pushed, Gemini will close the corresponding ticket in Linear.

**5. Move to the Next Task:**
*   With the previous ticket closed, we can then proceed to the next task in our plan.
