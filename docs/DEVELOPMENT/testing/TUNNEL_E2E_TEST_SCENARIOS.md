2. User clicks "Login" button
3. Supabase Auth OAuth flow is initiated
4. User enters credentials and authenticates
5. Application receives JWT token
6. TunnelService is initialized with auth token
7. TunnelService connects to streaming-proxy server
8. WebSocket connection is established
9. SSH tunnel is created to local server

**Expected Results:**

8. Response is sent back through tunnel
9. Response is delivered to client
10. Metrics are recorded

**Expected Results:**
- Request is successfully forwarded
- Response is received with correct status code

### 4b: Network Failure (Server Unreachable)

**Steps:**
1. User attempts to connect to unreachable server
2. Connection attempt times out
3. Error is caught and categorized

**Expected Results:**
- Connection fails with clear error message
- Error suggests checking network/firewall
- Automatic reconnection is triggered
- Error is logged

**Requirements Verified:**
- Requirement 1: Connection Resilience (error recovery)
- Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Handling (error categorization)

### 4c: Server Error (streaming-proxy returns 500)

**Steps:**
1. User sends request while server is experiencing error
2. streaming-proxy returns 500 error
3. CircuitBreaker detects failure
4. Request is retried or queued

**Expected Results:**
- Error is caught and handled gracefully
- CircuitBreaker enters OPEN state after threshold
- Requests are queued during outage
- CircuitBreaker recovers after timeout
- User sees appropriate error message

**Requirements Verified:**
- Requirement 2: Enhanced Error Handling (error recovery)
- Requirement 5: Request Queuing (backpressure)

### 4d: Rate Limit Exceeded

**Steps:**
1. User sends requests exceeding rate limit (>100 req/min)
2. RateLimiter detects violation
3. Request is rejected with 429 Too Many Requests

**Expected Results:**
- Request is rejected with 429 status
- Error message indicates rate limit exceeded
- Retry-After header is provided
- Metrics record rate limit violation
- User is notified

**Requirements Verified:**
- Requirement 3: Performance Monitoring (rate limit metrics)
- Requirement 4: Multi-Tenant Security (rate limiting)

## Test Scenario 5: Configuration Changes

**Objective:** Verify that configuration changes are applied correctly.

**Steps:**
1. User is logged in and tunnel is connected
2. User opens Tunnel Settings
3. User changes profile from "Stable" to "Unstable"
4. Configuration is validated
5. Configuration is saved
6. TunnelService is notified of config change
7. Tunnel reconnects with new configuration
8. New settings are applied

**Expected Results:**
