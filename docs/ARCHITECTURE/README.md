## 📖 Architecture Overview

CloudToLocalLLM follows a hybrid architecture that bridges cloud-based AI services with local AI models:

### Key Components
1. **Flutter Frontend** - Cross-platform desktop and web application
2. **Node.js Backend** - API services and authentication
3. **Tunnel System** - Secure WebSocket tunneling for real-time communication
4. **Streaming Proxy** - Multi-tenant proxy for WebSocket connections

### Design Principles
- **Privacy-first** - Sensitive data stays local when possible
- **Cross-platform** - Consistent experience across Windows, Linux, and Web
- **Secure** - End-to-end encryption and secure tunneling
- **Scalable** - Multi-tenant architecture with user tier system
