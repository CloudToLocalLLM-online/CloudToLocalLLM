## Authentication & Authorization

All admin routes use the `adminAuth` middleware which:

1. Validates JWT token from Authorization header
2. Verifies user has admin role in database
3. Checks user has required permissions for the operation
4. Attaches admin user info to request object

### Admin Roles

- **Super Admin**: All permissions (\*)
- **Support Admin**: view_users, edit_users, suspend_users, view_sessions, terminate_sessions, view_payments, view_audit_logs
- **Finance Admin**: view_users, view_payments, process_refunds, view_subscriptions, edit_subscriptions, view_reports, export_reports, view_audit_logs

## Database Schema

The admin routes interact with the following tables:

- `users` - User accounts with suspension fields
- `subscriptions` - User subscription information
- `payment_transactions` - Payment transaction records
- `payment_methods` - User payment method details
- `refunds` - Refund records
- `admin_roles` - Administrator role assignments
- `admin_audit_logs` - Comprehensive audit trail
- `user_sessions` - Active user sessions

## Audit Logging

All administrative actions are automatically logged to `admin_audit_logs` with:

- Admin user ID and role at time of action
- Action type and resource details
- Affected user ID
- IP address and user agent
- Timestamp and additional context (JSON)

## Error Handling

All routes follow a consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "code": "ERROR_CODE",
  "details": "Additional error details"
}
```

Common error codes:

- `NO_TOKEN` - No JWT token provided
- `INVALID_TOKEN` - Invalid or expired JWT token
- `ADMIN_ACCESS_REQUIRED` - User does not have admin role
- `INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS` - User lacks required permissions
- `INVALID_USER_ID` - Invalid user ID format
- `USER_NOT_FOUND` - User not found in database

## Database Connection

Each route file manages its own database connection pool with:

- Maximum 50 connections
- 10-minute idle timeout
- 30-second connection timeout
- Automatic error handling and reconnection
