## Next Steps

The following tasks are ready to be implemented:

### Task 2: Implement Data Models and Validation
- ✅ Connection state models (already in tunnel_models.dart)
- ✅ Request and response models (already in tunnel_models.dart)
- ✅ Error models with categorization (already in tunnel_models.dart)
- ✅ Metrics models (already in tunnel_models.dart)

**Note:** Task 2 was already completed as part of Task 1.2 when creating the data models.

### ✅ Task 4: Implement Request Queue (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Create PersistentRequestQueue class

- Intelligent exception categorization by type
- Specific handlers for SocketException, WebSocketChannelException, TimeoutException
- String-based categorization fallback
- HTTP status code to error code mapping
- Context-aware error messages and suggestions

**Key Features:**
- Detects network errors (connection refused, DNS failures, network unreachable)
- Identifies authentication errors (invalid credentials, expired tokens)
- Recognizes server errors (unavailable, rate limits, queue full)
- Categorizes protocol errors (SSH, WebSocket, compression, host key)
- Provides detailed error context for debugging

#### Sub-task 5.2: Build diagnostic test suite ✅
Created `diagnostics/diagnostic_test_suite.dart` with:
- DNS resolution test

   - 60 second timeout
   - 200 request queue size

## Usage (After Implementation)

```dart
// Get services from dependency injection
final tunnelService = serviceLocator.get<TunnelService>();
final requestQueue = serviceLocator.get<RequestQueue>();
final metricsCollector = serviceLocator.get<MetricsCollector>();

// Connect to tunnel
await tunnelService.connect(
  serverUrl: 'wss://api.cloudtolocalllm.online/tunnel',
  authToken: accessToken,
  config: TunnelConfig.stableNetwork(),
);

// Forward request
final response = await tunnelService.forwardRequest(
  TunnelRequest(
    id: 'req-123',
    userId: userId,
    payload: requestData,
  ),
);

// Get metrics
final metrics = metricsCollector.getMetrics();
print('Success rate: ${metrics.successRate}');
print('Average latency: ${metrics.averageLatency}');
```
