## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

To report a vulnerability, please do **not** open a public issue. Instead, please report it via the "Security" tab in this repository (if enabled) or contact the maintainers directly at:

**Email**: `support@cloudtolocalllm.online`
*(Please include "[SECURITY]" in the subject line)*

We aim to acknowledge reports within 48 hours and provide updates on the remediation process.

## Infrastructure Security

We take security seriously. Our architecture is designed to provide enterprise-grade security whether you are running a single local instance or a full cloud deployment.

### Deployment Security Parity
**Same Code, Same Security**: We adhere to a strict "security consistency" policy. **Local instances** verify and enforce the exact same security standards as our Cloud deployments. There are no "weakened" local dev modes; the security controls you see in production are the same ones protecting your local machine.

### Built-in Protections
*   **Non-Root Execution**: All our containers are architected to run as unprivileged non-root users, utilizing minimal base images to reduce the attack surface.
*   **Network Isolation**: Our specific `docker-compose` network definitions strictly isolate backend services (like the database and Ollama bridge) from the public internet. Only the API Gateway is exposed.
*   **Automated Rate Limiting**: All sensitive endpoints (Auth, API Keys) are protected by strict, adaptive rate limits by default to prevent abuse.

### Authentication & Secrets
*   **Secure Defaults**: We enforce industry-standard JWT validation and API key hashing. Keys are never stored in plain text.
*   **Encrypted Tunnels**: All traffic between local LLMs and the cloud proxy uses encrypted WebSocket tunnels (WSS) and SSH tunneling, ensuring data privacy in transit.
*   **Production-Ready Configuration**: Our default configurations enforce HTTPS, secure headers (Helmet), and strict cookie policies out of the box.
