  "reasoning": "The latest commit is a feature (feat) that refactors the Kubernetes deployment structure using Argo CD. This change only affects the Kubernetes manifests. Therefore, a minor version bump to 7.14.0 is required. Only the managed (cloud) and local (k8s) deployments are affected and need to be updated. No application or desktop/mobile code was changed, so no new builds for those targets are necessary."
