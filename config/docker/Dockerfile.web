COPY --chown=1000:1000 pubspec.yaml pubspec.lock ./

# Get dependencies (run as default user - no USER switch needed if container handles it)
RUN flutter pub get

# Copy the rest of the application source code with proper ownership
COPY --chown=1000:1000 . .

# Build Flutter web app (container default user)
RUN flutter build web --release
