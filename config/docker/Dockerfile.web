# ============================================================================
# Multi-stage Dockerfile for CloudToLocalLLM Web Application
# Stage 1: Build Flutter web application (using pre-built Flutter image)
# Stage 2: Serve with nginx (non-root)
# ============================================================================

# ---- Stage 1: Build Flutter Web App ----
FROM ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter:stable AS builder

# Fix Flutter SDK ownership and permissions (must be done as root)
# Cirrus containers have Flutter SDK at /sdks/flutter, owned by root
# We need to give the non-root user (UID 1000) access to write to cache
RUN chown -R 1000:1000 /sdks/flutter && \
    chmod -R u+w /sdks/flutter

# Fix Git safe directory (Flutter SDK uses Git internally)
RUN git config --global --add safe.directory /sdks/flutter

# Create and set ownership of app directory before switching users
WORKDIR /app
RUN chown -R 1000:1000 /app

# Copy files with proper ownership for non-root user
COPY --chown=1000:1000 pubspec.yaml pubspec.lock ./

# Switch to non-root user before Flutter commands
USER 1000

# Get dependencies (Flutter will create .dart_tool and other cache dirs)
RUN flutter pub get

# Copy the rest of the application source code with proper ownership
COPY --chown=1000:1000 . .

# Build Flutter web app
RUN flutter build web --release

# ---- Stage 2: Serve with Nginx (non-root) ----
FROM nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:alpine

# Copy custom nginx configuration
COPY config/docker/nginx-web.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Copy built Flutter web app from builder stage
COPY --from=builder --chown=nginx:nginx /app/build/web /usr/share/nginx/html
