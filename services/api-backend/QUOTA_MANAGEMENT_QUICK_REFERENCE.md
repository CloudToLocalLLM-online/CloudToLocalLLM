# Quota Management Implementation - Quick Reference

## Overview

Quota management system for tracking and enforcing resource usage limits per user tier.

**Validates: Requirements 6.6**
- Implements quota management for resource usage
- Tracks quota usage per user
- Enforces quota limits
- Provides quota reporting

## Files Created

### Database Migration
- `database/migrations/018_quota_management.sql` - Creates quota tables and indexes

### Service
- `services/quota-service.js` - Core quota management service

### Routes
- `routes/quotas.js` - REST API endpoints for quota management

### Tests
- `test/api-backend/quota-management.test.js` - Unit tests (15 tests, all passing)

## Database Schema

### Tables

**quota_definitions**
- Defines quota limits per tier (free, premium, enterprise)
- Stores resource types and limits

**user_quotas**
- Tracks current quota usage per user
- Stores period start/end dates
- Tracks if quota is exceeded

**quota_events**
- Logs all quota-related events
- Records usage deltas and percentages

## API Endpoints

### GET /quotas
Get all quotas for current user
- Response: Array of quota objects

### GET /quotas/:resourceType
Get quota for specific resource type
- Path: resourceType (api_requests, data_transfer, etc.)
- Response: Single quota object

### GET /quotas/events
Get quota events for current user
- Query: resourceType, eventType, limit, offset
- Response: Array of quota events

### GET /quotas/summary
Get quota summary for current user
- Response: Summary with total quotas, exceeded count, near-limit count

### POST /quotas/:resourceType/reset (Admin only)
Reset quota for a resource type
- Path: resourceType
- Body: { userId }
- Response: Reset quota object

## Service Methods

### getQuotaDefinition(tier, resourceType)
Get quota definition for a tier and resource type

### initializeUserQuotas(userId, userTier)
Initialize quotas for a new user based on their tier

### recordQuotaUsage(userId, resourceType, usageDelta, details)
Record quota usage and check if exceeded

### getUserQuotaUsage(userId, resourceType)
Get current quota usage for a user

### isQuotaExceeded(userId, resourceType)
Check if user has exceeded quota

### getUserAllQuotas(userId)
Get all quotas for a user

### getQuotaEvents(userId, options)
Get quota events with optional filtering

### resetQuota(userId, resourceType)
Reset quota usage (admin only)

### getQuotaSummary(userId)
Get quota summary with statistics

## Default Quota Limits

### Free Tier
- API Requests: 10,000/month
- Data Transfer: 1 GB/month
- Concurrent Connections: 5
- Tunnels: 3

### Premium Tier
- API Requests: 1,000,000/month
- Data Transfer: 100 GB/month
- Concurrent Connections: 100
- Tunnels: 50

### Enterprise Tier
- API Requests: Unlimited
- Data Transfer: Unlimited
- Concurrent Connections: Unlimited
- Tunnels: Unlimited

## Integration Points

1. **User Service**: Initialize quotas when user is created
2. **Rate Limiting**: Check quotas before allowing requests
3. **Tunnel Service**: Track tunnel usage against quotas
4. **Proxy Service**: Track proxy usage against quotas
5. **Admin Service**: Allow admins to reset quotas

## Testing

Run tests:
```bash
npm test -- test/api-backend/quota-management.test.js
```

Test Coverage:
- 15 tests covering all core functionality
- Tests for quota definition retrieval
- Tests for quota initialization
- Tests for usage recording and enforcement
- Tests for quota reporting and summaries

## Error Handling

- Quota not found: 404 Not Found
- Invalid input: 400 Bad Request
- Unauthorized: 401 Unauthorized
- Forbidden (admin only): 403 Forbidden
- Server error: 500 Internal Server Error

## Performance Considerations

- Quotas are cached in memory during request processing
- Database queries use indexes on user_id, resource_type, and period dates
- Quota events are logged asynchronously
- Monthly reset is handled automatically based on period dates

## Future Enhancements

1. Webhook notifications when quota is near limit
2. Automatic quota upgrade suggestions
3. Usage analytics and trends
4. Custom quota limits for enterprise users
5. Quota sharing between team members
